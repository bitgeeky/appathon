# Android Application (Idea)
(Vaccination and  Polio ): Notify Users about the Polio camp in their area so that they can go and get notifications , also keep a track of users in area who have got the the drops  so that doctors don't waste their time going to each and every house to check whether the drops are given or not and provide a basic calender for vaccination and provide  contact details of their nearest dispenseries.

The Application Requires to be deployed on a good server so that , Notifications can be broadcasted , apart from polio , Awareness for other diseases can also be created and a better vaccination system.
Application to be ported in local/multi languages , apart from current Hindi and English version.
