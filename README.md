# Android Application (Idea)
(Vaccination and  Polio ): Notify Users about the Polio camp in their area so that they can go and get notifications , also keep a track of users in area who have got the the drops  so that doctors don't waste their time going to each and every house to check whether the drops are given or not and provide a basic calender for vaccination and provide  contact details of their nearest dispenseries.

The Application Requires to be deployed on a good server so that , Notifications can be broadcasted , apart from polio , Awareness for other diseases can also be created and a better vaccination system.
Application to be ported in local/multi languages , apart from current Hindi and English version.

# Future Scope 
Since this application is targated to to mostly rural and illiterate users , so the interenet connectivity should be minimal.
The messages should be conveyed mostly through voice signals or interactive animations  

The Application should not only be focussed on Vaccination and Polio Drops, but should has health notifications in general 
also to broadcast any health related news and get response from users.

# Modified Idea for Practical Use
Abstract idea :
1 Provide users the information(in form of voice) about various health problems/diseases ,
their symptoms and Precautions.

2 Focus on problems like TB, Malaria, Jaundice and others which are main cause of health
related deaths on rural areas.

3 Focus on problems which the public is not comfortable to ask questions about , the
problems which are considered stigma in society eg : HIV/AIDS , Contraception , Pregnancy

4 Notifications about health from the medical institutes would become a secondary/additional
feature

Implementation Details :
1 The application would be focused for use by illiterate rural public ,

2 There would be tiles/cards each showing picture/image for related organ or would pictorially
represent a health problem , on clicking user must be able to listen to voice recording ,
enlisting the symptoms , precautions for the problem and steps to be taken if someone
realizes he/she is suffering from it (may be contact details of nearest specialized
dispensary/doctor)
Note : here we would not provide any medicine suggestions or treatment

3 Notifications which would be broadcast from the medical institutes would be voice messages
(technology yet to be decided) without using internet

Thus we would deal with the previous limitations of Application i.e
1 No internet connectivity required
2 Application would be able to be used by illiterate and rural people
3 The user would be using application more often to see whether the symptoms match his/her
problems

Our Notifications idea would now become a secondary/additional feature but would still be there in
application

End Users :
1 Community (mostly rural) to check symptoms for a problem and get advice on precautions and
contact details of nearest specialized medical institutes
2 Medical Institutes to broadcast health related notifications
